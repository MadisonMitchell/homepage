      Hello! My name is Madie Mitchell. I am a sophomore Information Technology major with a minor in Business Management at Point Park 
      University.I have always had a passion for data analytics and statistics and hope to become a Data Analyst in my future. Outside 
      of my class work, I enjoy oil painting, intaglio and other printmaking, studying the German language, experimenting with  recipies,
      and caring for my cat. Feel free to explore this little website that I am creating for myself. Thank you!
